Here, we utilize
machine learning to estimate the wine quality based on multiple 
criteria, which is motivated by the success of ML in various 
industries. Among various ML models, we compare the 
performance of Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector 
Classifier (SVC), K – Neighbors Classifier (KNC), Decision Tree 
Classifier, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting Classifier to 
predict the wine quality. Multiple parameters that determine 
the wine quality are analyzed. Our analysis shows that Random 
Forest Classifier surpasses all other models’ performance with 
an accuracy score of 90.59 %. This work demonstrates, how 
statistical analysis can be used to identify the components that 
mainly control the wine quality prior to production
